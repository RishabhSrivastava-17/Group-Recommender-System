We generate groups of users of user defined size and tried to predict group ratings using methods described below.

There are numerous techniques for preference aggregation that is generally divided into three categories:
Majority-based strategies which use the most popular items for aggregation (e.g., Plurality Voting)
Consensus-based strategies where preferences of all group members are considered (e.g., Average, Average without Misery, Fairness)
Borderline strategies which only considers a subset (e.g., Dictatorship, Least Misery, Most Pleasure)
